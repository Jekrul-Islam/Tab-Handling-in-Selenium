Selenium Tutorial: Handling Multiple Tabs in Selenium

This tutorial demonstrates how to manage multiple tabs in Selenium WebDriver using Java. Handling multiple browser tabs is a common scenario while automating web apps. By using selenium we can easily handle and switch to different tabs and windows.

Prerequisites:

Java Development Kit (JDK) installed (Java 8+ recommended).
Selenium WebDriver library configured in the project (via Maven or manual setup).
Chrome Browser installed along with the **ChromeDriver.
TestNG for running the test cases.


Key Concepts in Tab Handling

When automating web application’s tests, you may need to interact with browsers that have multiple tabs. Each tab or window is assigned a unique identifier, known as a window handle. In Selenium we can retrieve those identifiers and can use them to switch to the expected tab.

Scenario Overview

In this tutorial, you will:
1. Open a website that contains a link to another site.
2. Click on the link, which opens a new tab.
3. Switch to the new tab and perform actions on that tab.
4. Close the new tab once the actions are complete.
5. Switch back to the original tab and continue the automation.

Process Breakdown

1. Launching the Browser and Navigating to a Website:
   The test begins by launching the browser and navigating to a target website. Chrome options are configured to handle any SSL certificate errors that may arise during browsing.

2. Identifying the Parent Window:
   Before interacting with any elements, the handle of the current (parent) window is stored. This is essential for switching back to the original tab after working with the newly opened tab.

3. Waiting for Elements to be Clickable:
   WebDriver’s `WebDriverWait` is used to wait for elements (such as links) to become clickable before attempting any interaction. This ensures that Selenium does not attempt to click on elements prematurely.

4. Handling the Link that Opens a New Tab:
   The automation script identifies a link on the page, which, when clicked, opens a new tab. Upon clicking the link, all currently open window handles are retrieved to identify the new tab.

5. Switching to the Newly Opened Tab:
   Once the new tab is identified, Selenium switches focus to it. This allows you to perform actions such as clicking buttons or filling out forms or any other actions in the new tab.

6. Performing Actions on the New Tab:
   After switching to the new tab, the automation script waits for specific elements on the new page to become clickable, ensuring the interaction takes place at the right time.

7. Closing the New Tab:
   After completing the required actions, the new tab is closed, freeing up system resources and avoiding unnecessary tabs being left open.

8. Switching Back to the Parent Tab:
   After the new tab is closed, Selenium switches focus back to the original (parent) window, allowing further actions to be performed on the initial page.

9. Quitting the Browser:
   At the end of the test, the browser session is terminated, closing all windows and cleaning up the WebDriver session.

Smooth Scrolling

In the parent window before clicking on the link that will take us to the new tab, we have developed a function that will smooth the scrolling. This smooth scrolling will provide more natural experience. To do so, the function smoothScrollToElement is implemented.

Conclusion

This tutorial covered how to efficiently handle multiple tabs in Selenium WebDriver. By utilizing window handles, you can manage interactions across multiple tabs, perform actions, and seamlessly switch between windows. This technique is especially useful in cases where external links or pop-up tabs are part of the web application.
